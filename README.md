# topological-insulator-spin-hall
Ab initio calculation of the spin Hall conductivity in topological insulators using Quantum ESPRESSO and Wannier90 codes.

### Set paths
The file `set-path` needs to be modified with the correct paths to the root directories of Quantum ESPRESSO and Wannier90 folders on your machine.
```shell 
QE_PATH=$HOME/qe-6.4.1              # replace with your quantum espresso path
WANNIER_PATH=$HOME/wannier90-3.0.0  # replace with your wannier90 path 
```
